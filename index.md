## [](#header-2) I am a PhD Candidate in Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University. I work at the [CREATE Lab](http://www.cmucreatelab.org) with my advisor [Professor Illah Nourbakhsh](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~illah/). I work on the CREATE Lab's [Arts & Bots](http://www.cmucreatelab.org/projects/Arts_&_Bots) project and [Flutter](http://www.cmucreatelab.org/projects/Flutter) project. My primary research interests include human-robot interaction with a focus on educational applications of robotics and diversity in engineering education.
