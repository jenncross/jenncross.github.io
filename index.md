Hi, I'm Jenn. I am a Research Assistant Professor at the [Tufts University Center for Engineering Education and Outreach](https://ceeo.tufts.edu/). My primary research interests focus on supporting teacher and student technological fluency, creativity, and computational thinking through transdisciplinary technology integration and education-focused human-robot interaction.

Previously, I worked on the [Arts & Bots](http://www.cmucreatelab.org/projects/Arts_&_Bots) project and [Flutter](http://www.cmucreatelab.org/projects/Flutter) project at the Carnegie Mellon University [CREATE Lab](https://cmucreatelab.org/).

## Research Focus

My research explores how technology integration can enhance education across disciplines. I am particularly interested in:

-   Supporting teacher technological fluency through professional development
-   Creating educational robotics experiences that engage diverse learners
-   Developing human-robot interaction designs for educational contexts
-   Fostering creative expression through technology
