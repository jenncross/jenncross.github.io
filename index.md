    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a Research Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://ceeo.tufts.edu/">Tufts University Center for Engineering Education and Outreach</a>. I design interactive systems through participatory methodologies, bridging robotics, human-centered design, and education.</p>
    
    <p> My interdisciplinary training has encompassed many fields. I worked as a postdoctoral scholar in the <a href="https://www.ceeoinnovations.org/fetlab/">Future Educational Technologies Lab</a> at Tufts University mentored by Prof. Chris Rogers. I completed my Ph.D. and M.S. in Robotics at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University under the supervision of Prof. Illah Nourbakhsh. My graduate studies were supported by fellowships from both the National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship Program and the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) Program for Interdisciplinary Education Research. My undergraduate studies were in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the F. W. Olin College of Engineering. </p>

  <h2>Current Research Interests</h2>
  
  <p>My research integrates participatory design with empirical research to create intuitive systems and interfaces. I focus on three methodological approaches that span across my projects:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Participatory Design & Development:</strong> Collaborating with stakeholders to create intuitive software and tangible interaction paradigms</li>
    <li><strong>Design-Based Research:</strong> Building empirically-grounded principles through systematic research-design cycles</li>
    <li><strong>Interdisciplinary Engineering Education:</strong> Developing systems that create connections between engineering and other disciplines</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Teaching</h2>
  
  <p>My teaching integrates technical skill development with design methodologies and critical thinking. I create learning environments that foster student creativity and problem-solving abilities through project-based learning.</p>
  
  <p>Current courses include Introduction to Computing in Engineering, Engineering Design Lab, and Human-Robot Interaction.</p>
