    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm a Research Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://ceeo.tufts.edu/">Tufts University Center for Engineering Education and Outreach</a>. I design interactive systems through participatory methodologies, bridging robotics, human-centered design, and education.</p>
    
    <p>I completed my Ph.D. in Robotics at the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute, advised by <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~illah/">Professor Illah Nourbakhsh</a>. I was a fellow of both the IES-supported <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/pier/">Program for Interdisciplinary Education Research</a> and the <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program</a>. I completed my undergraduate degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the <a href="http://olin.edu/">F. W. Olin College of Engineering</a>.</p>

  <h2>Current Research Interests</h2>
  
  <p>My research integrates participatory design with empirical research to create intuitive systems and interfaces. I focus on three methodological approaches that span across my projects:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Participatory Design & Development:</strong> Collaborating with stakeholders to create intuitive software and tangible interaction paradigms</li>
    <li><strong>Design-Based Research:</strong> Building empirically-grounded principles through systematic research-design cycles</li>
    <li><strong>Interdisciplinary Engineering Education:</strong> Developing systems that create connections between engineering and other disciplines</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Teaching</h2>
  
  <p>My teaching integrates technical skill development with design methodologies and critical thinking. I create learning environments that foster student creativity and problem-solving abilities through project-based learning.</p>
  
  <p>Current courses include Introduction to Computing in Engineering, Engineering Design Lab, and Human-Robot Interaction.</p>
