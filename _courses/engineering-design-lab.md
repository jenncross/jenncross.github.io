This intensive pre-college program introduces high school students to robotics concepts, Python programming, and hardware prototyping through scaffolded challenges and team projects. Students develop skills in CAD, laser cutting, 3D printing, electronics, and programming while solving real-world engineering problems.

The program combines structured learning activities with open-ended design challenges, allowing students to apply their skills creatively while developing technical proficiency. Over the course of the program, students progress from basic skills development to complex, interdisciplinary projects that integrate multiple technologies.

## Learning Objectives

-   Develop fundamental programming skills using Python
-   Apply computational thinking to solve engineering challenges
-   Design and fabricate physical prototypes using digital fabrication tools
-   Integrate sensors and actuators into working systems
-   Collaborate effectively in interdisciplinary project teams
-   Document and communicate technical work clearly

## Program Structure

The program is structured as a two-week intensive experience with approximately 6 hours of engagement per day. The first week focuses on skill development through guided challenges in programming, electronics, and fabrication. The second week centers on team projects where students apply their skills to solve a design challenge of their choosing.

Daily activities include:

-   Technical workshops to develop specific skills
-   Hands-on lab time for experimentation and project work
-   Design thinking activities to support the creative process
-   Team collaboration and peer feedback sessions
-   Documentation and reflection exercises

Each day builds on previous learning while introducing new concepts and technologies. The program culminates in a showcase event where students present their projects to peers, family, and community members.
