This foundational course introduces engineering students to computational thinking and problem-solving techniques using Python. Students develop skills in algorithm design, data analysis, and visualization through project-based learning experiences with applications across engineering disciplines.

The course structure includes weekly lectures, hands-on programming labs, and three major projects that progressively build students' capabilities from basic programming concepts to complex data analysis and visualization tasks.

## Learning Objectives

-   Develop proficiency in Python programming for engineering applications
-   Apply computational thinking to solve engineering problems
-   Analyze and visualize data using appropriate libraries and tools
-   Implement mathematical models and simulations for engineering systems
-   Communicate technical information effectively through documentation and presentations

## Teaching Approach

My teaching approach for this course emphasizes hands-on, project-based learning. Students engage in regular programming exercises that build toward larger projects with real-world applications. I incorporate pair programming techniques and collaborative problem-solving to foster a community of practice among engineering students.

The course balances theoretical concepts with practical implementation, ensuring students develop both conceptual understanding and technical proficiency. Formative assessments throughout the semester provide students with regular feedback on their progress.
