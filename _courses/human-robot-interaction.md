This graduate-level course explores the theoretical foundations and practical applications of human-robot interaction (HRI). Students learn principles of interaction design, evaluation methodologies, and implementation techniques for creating effective robotic systems that can interact with humans in intuitive and helpful ways.

The course covers key HRI topics including social robotics, interface design, user study methodologies, and ethical considerations in robot design. Through a combination of readings, discussions, and hands-on projects, students develop a comprehensive understanding of the multidisciplinary field of HRI.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand core theories and principles of human-robot interaction
- Design and implement effective robot interfaces and interaction patterns
- Apply appropriate research methodologies to evaluate human-robot systems
- Analyze qualitative and quantitative data from HRI experiments
- Communicate research findings effectively through papers and presentations
- Consider ethical implications of robots in various contexts

## Course Structure

The course is organized around three main components:

1. **Theoretical Foundations**: Weekly readings and discussions on HRI theories, frameworks, and current research
2. **Research Methods**: Workshops on experimental design, data collection, and analysis techniques specific to HRI
3. **Research Project**: A semester-long original research project conducted in teams, culminating in a conference-style paper and presentation

The course emphasizes the development of both theoretical knowledge and practical skills in designing, implementing, and evaluating human-robot interactions.
