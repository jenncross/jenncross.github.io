## Fused Glass Art

Since 2010, I have designed and created glass art pieces using various methods. I primarily work with kiln-formed fused glass though I also have experience with stained glass and torch-worked glass beads. Working with glass requires an exciting combination of artistic creativity and material science knowledge. I especially enjoy experimenting with the chemical reactions between materials and fluid mechanics in my work.

## Material Exploration

My creative practice serves as a laboratory for exploring material properties and behaviors. I approach glass work with both an artist's aesthetic sensibility and an engineer's analytical mindset, investigating:

-   Chemical interactions between different glass compositions
-   Thermal dynamics in kiln-forming processes
-   Material flow and deformation under heat
-   Surface tension effects in molten materials
-   Structural properties of layered compositions

These explorations enhance my understanding of material science concepts that I integrate into my teaching and research.

## Integration with Teaching

My creative practice directly informs my approach to engineering education. I draw parallels between artistic material exploration and engineering design processes when teaching concepts such as:

-   Iterative prototyping and testing
-   Material selection and properties
-   Heat transfer and thermal dynamics
-   Structural integrity and failure analysis
-   Aesthetic considerations in engineering design

Through examples from my glass work, I help students understand the connections between creative exploration and technical problem-solving.
