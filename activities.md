## Fused Glass Art

Through the [Pittsburgh Glass Center](https://www.pittsburghglasscenter.org/), I design and create glass art pieces. I primarily work with kiln-formed fused glass though I also have experience with stained glass and torch-worked glass beads. Working with glass requires an exciting combination of artistic creativity and material science knowledge. I especially enjoy experimenting with the chemical reactions between materials and fluid mechanics in my work.

## Women@SCS

I have been actively involved in [Women@SCS](https://www.women.cs.cmu.edu/), an organization dedicated to supporting women in computer science at Carnegie Mellon University. As a graduate student, I helped organize outreach activities and workshops to introduce young women to computer science and robotics.
