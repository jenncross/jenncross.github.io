# About

{% include image.html src="/images/IMG_6629_noglare.jpg" alt="Jennifer Cross" class="profile-image" %}

I am a [research assistant professor](https://engineering.tufts.edu/people/faculty/jennifer-cross) at the [Tufts University Center for Engineering Education and Outreach](https://ceeo.tufts.edu/). My primary research interests focus on supporting teacher and student technological fluency, creativity, and computational thinking through transdisciplinary technology integration and education-focused human-robot interaction.

Previously, I worked on the [Arts & Bots](http://www.cmucreatelab.org/projects/Arts_&_Bots) project and [Flutter](http://www.cmucreatelab.org/projects/Flutter) project at the Carnegie Mellon University [CREATE Lab](https://cmucreatelab.org/).

## Education

I completed my Ph.D. in Robotics at the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute and was advised by [Professor Illah Nourbakhsh](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~illah/). I was a fellow of both the IES-supported [Program for Interdisciplinary Education Research](http://www.cmu.edu/pier/) and the [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

I completed my undergraduate degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [F. W. Olin College of Engineering](http://olin.edu/) in Massachusetts where I was a member of the fifth graduating class.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on three interconnected areas:

### Participatory Design & Development

I collaborate with teachers and students to design and rapidly prototype innovative coding interfaces for robotics education, creating intuitive software and tangible interaction paradigms.

### Design-Based Research for Human-Robot Interaction

I build empirically-grounded principles of human-robot interaction while creating practical educational technologies through systematic research-design cycles.

### Interdisciplinary Engineering Education

I develop systems and frameworks to create mutually beneficial connections between engineering and other disciplines, enhancing learning and engagement to support all learners' educational experiences.

## Personal Interests

When I am not working on robotics and education research, I enjoy creating kiln-formed [fused glass](/activities) and spending time outdoors gardening. I am a member of the [Society of Women Engineers](http://societyofwomenengineers.swe.org/), [American Society for Engineering Education](https://www.asee.org/) and [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/).
