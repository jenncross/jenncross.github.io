## Project Overview

On Smart Playground project, our team is reimagining the playground as a programmable robotic system that kindergarten children can control through play-based interactions. Unlike traditional approaches to teaching computational thinking that rely on screen-based activities, this project translates programming concepts into tangible, physical experiences on school playgrounds where children engage in exploratory learning.

## Design Approach

The development team, at Tufts University, is rapidly prototyping, iteratively testing, and responding to feedback from participatory design sessions with kindergarten students, teachers, and families in Santa Ana. I coordinate and advise our team's efforts on the following aspects of the design process:

1. Designing and implementing interface prototypes based on co-design feedback from our UCI partners
2. Refining usability testing methodologies for kindergarten-aged users
3. Evaluating interface designs for developmental appropriateness
4. Developing interaction models that can be implemented across various playground settings

## My Contribution

As Co-Investigator supporting technical development and leading interaction design efforts, my primary responsibilities include:

**Interface & Interaction Design** - I design and develop embedded devices that enable the control of tangible programming interfaces appropriate for kindergarten users.

-   Transforming feedback from co-design partners into actionable design specifications
-   Enhancing the knowledge exchange between our technical team and education researchers

**Interdisciplinary Integration** - I help bridge gaps between computational thinking concepts, early childhood development, and physical play by:

-   Identifying opportunities to embed computational thinking into play activities and kindergarten educational objectives
-   Translating playground activities and actions into computational thinking concepts (sequences, patterns, loops, and conditionals)
-   Developing scaffolded learning experiences that progress from simple to more advanced
