## Overview

In Olin College's Advanced Computing Lab, I collaborated with a partner to design and prototype an "exploded" model of an FPGA processor. This educational tool physically represented the complex architecture of field-programmable gate arrays at a much larger scale, making the abstract concepts tangible and comprehensible.

## Key Contributions

-   Selected appropriate components and designed circuit layouts for memory chip-based logic blocks
-   Prototyped printed circuit boards for logic blocks in a reconfigurable and expandable array format
-   Developed a specialized Python assembler to simplify reprogramming of look-up tables and FPGA behavior
-   Created educational materials explaining FPGA concepts through the physical model
-   Presented the design to faculty and industry representatives

## Educational Impact

The physical representation of FPGA architecture served as a powerful learning tool by:

-   Making abstract computing concepts tangible through large-scale physical models
-   Demonstrating interconnection patterns and programmable logic visually
-   Showing real-time configuration changes through interactive elements
-   Providing hands-on experience with digital logic concepts

## Technologies & Methods

-   Circuit design and PCB prototyping
-   Python programming for custom assembler development
-   Digital logic design principles
-   Educational tool development methodology
-   Iterative prototyping techniques
