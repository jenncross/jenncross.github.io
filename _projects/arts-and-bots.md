## Project Overview

Arts & Bots was an educational robotics program developed by the Carnegie Mellon CREATE Lab that addressed a critical challenge in STEM education: how to engage a broader, more diverse group of students with engineering and computing concepts. Unlike traditional robotics initiatives like FIRST or VEX Robotics Competition that emphasized competition and task-completion in self-selected contexts, Arts & Bots focused on creativity and inclusivity by integrating robotics directly into required core classes.

My work on Arts & Bots focused on developing and evaluating models for effectively integrating robotics into non-technical classrooms. By embedding creative robotics activities within required courses such as language arts, social studies, and health education, we reached students who might never have self-selected into traditional robotics programs. This approach allowed teachers to use robotics as a creative communication medium and provided new formative assessment opportunities that helped educators see their students' capabilities in a different light.

## Program Design & Implementation

The Arts & Bots program combined four key elements designed to support creative expression and cross-disciplinary learning:

1. **Craft Materials**: Students use everyday craft and building materials to create personalized robot exteriors, making the technology more approachable and allowing for personal expression.

2. **Flexible Hardware Kit**: Centered around the Hummingbird microcontroller, the kit includes various outputs (DC motors, hobby servos, RGB LEDs, single color LEDs, vibration motors) and sensors (temperature, light, sound-level, distance, and potentiometers).

3. **Interactive Visual Programming Environment**: A custom-designed software environment that makes programming accessible to novice programmers, reducing barriers to participation.

4. **Adaptable Curriculum**: Integration strategies that enhance existing subject content rather than displacing it, making robotics relevant to core learning objectives.

This combination supports a constructionist approach to learning, where students develop understanding and skills through the creation of meaningful artifacts within authentic contexts.

## Research Focus

My research with Arts & Bots addressed two primary questions:

1. How could robotics be meaningfully integrated into required, non-technical classes to engage diverse students who might not otherwise participate in engineering experiences?

2. What integration models and design elements enabled teachers to effectively incorporate robotics as both a learning tool and an assessment opportunity?

These questions were explored through several key research areas:

-   **Integration Models**: Developing frameworks for how non-technical teachers could effectively incorporate robotics into their curriculum while meeting subject-specific learning objectives.

-   **Student Engagement**: Examining how creative robotics activities in non-elective courses built confidence and interest in engineering among diverse student populations.

-   **Teacher Development**: Creating professional development approaches that enabled educators without technical backgrounds to successfully implement robotics activities.

-   **Assessment Opportunities**: Exploring how robotics projects provided alternative assessment pathways that helped teachers recognize diverse student capabilities and learning styles.

## Program Impact

Between 2010 and 2017, Arts & Bots engaged over 2,400 students and 360 educators across Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia, as well as internationally in Brazil and the United Kingdom. The program was particularly successful in reaching students who might not otherwise have selected into technology activities.

Our evaluation results showed that:

1. Students in required courses who would not have chosen elective robotics classes gained significant experience with engineering design, programming, and electronics through Arts & Bots.

2. Teachers observed students engaging with course content in new ways, often discovering capabilities in students that weren't evident through traditional classwork.

3. Both students and teachers reported increased confidence with technology after participating in integrated robotics projects.

4. The integration into required classes successfully eliminated self-selection bias and reached a more diverse student population than typical extracurricular robotics programs.

## My Contributions

As a key researcher on the Arts & Bots program, my contributions included:

1. **Integration Framework**: Developed models for how robotics can be effectively integrated into non-technical classes, providing a framework for curriculum design that serves both subject content and engineering learning goals.

2. **Teacher Professional Development**: Created and refined an effective model for training non-technical teachers to use robotics meaningfully in their classrooms, building their confidence and capacity.

3. **Classroom Implementation Studies**: Documented and analyzed implementation details across diverse classroom contexts, identifying success factors and challenges in different subject areas.

4. **Assessment Tools**: Developed formative and process assessment approaches that helped teachers recognize student capabilities that might not be evident in traditional classwork.

5. **Evaluation Instruments**: Created and implemented evaluation tools to assess both student learning outcomes and teacher implementation experiences.

6. **Design Recommendations**: Identified key affordances of successful integration models and developed design recommendations for educational robotics tools that support cross-disciplinary learning.

## Case Studies

Two particularly successful integration models that I studied in depth included:

### English Language Arts Integration

In English classes, students created robots that represented characters or scenes from literature they were studying, such as Romeo and Juliet. This approach allowed students to demonstrate narrative understanding and textual analysis through a new medium, while simultaneously developing technical skills. Teachers reported that the projects revealed insights into student comprehension that weren't apparent through traditional written assignments.

### Health Education Integration

In health classes, students built robotic models of physiological systems, such as the knee musculoskeletal structure shown in the featured image. Students programmed servo motors to demonstrate joint movement when triggered by sensors, combining anatomy learning with engineering principles. This hands-on approach engaged students who struggled with traditional textbook learning and provided teachers with a new window into student understanding.

## Conclusions and Future Directions

The Arts & Bots program demonstrated that creative robotics could serve as a powerful cross-disciplinary learning tool when thoughtfully integrated into required classes. By embedding robotics within existing curriculum rather than isolating it in elective courses, we reached a broader, more diverse group of students and provided new opportunities for them to develop confidence and interest in engineering.

Our research highlighted several key principles for effective integration:

1. Robotics activities should enhance rather than displace existing subject content
2. Creative expression should be valued alongside technical learning
3. Teacher professional development must build both confidence and competence
4. Projects should provide alternative assessment opportunities that reveal student capabilities
5. Integration should be designed to reach students who might not self-select into technology experiences
