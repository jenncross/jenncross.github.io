## Overview

As part of the Olin Biomimetic Robotics Lab, I led the development of a shark-inspired robot to explore novel locomotion mechanisms. This project investigated how biological principles could inform more efficient underwater propulsion systems through biomimetic design.

## Key Contributions

-   Conducted comprehensive research on shark swimming motions and biomechanics to inform design decisions
-   Explored and evaluated various materials for replicating musculoskeletal systems, including McKibben artificial pneumatic muscles
-   Designed full mechanical system models using SolidWorks for prototype development
-   Fabricated proof-of-concept prototype and conducted performance testing
-   Presented findings and design iterations to faculty and peers during weekly design reviews

## Technologies & Methods

-   SolidWorks for 3D modeling and design
-   McKibben artificial pneumatic muscles for biomimetic actuation
-   Rapid prototyping techniques
