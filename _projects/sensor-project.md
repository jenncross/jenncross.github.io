## Overview

As part of my senior capstone project, I collaborated with MIT's Lincoln Laboratory to develop a novel position sensing system for robotics applications. Our team designed and implemented a multi-sensor approach that combined several low-cost commercial technologies to achieve robust positioning capabilities comparable to more expensive solutions.

## Key Contributions

- Researched and evaluated various sensor technologies based on cost-effectiveness, precision, and integration potential
- Designed complementary sub-systems that minimized error through strategic sensor fusion approaches
- Implemented large-scale sensor integration using LabVIEW for real-time data acquisition and processing
- Led the team as Project Manager during critical implementation phases
- Managed timeline, resources, and technical requirements across multiple stakeholders

## Systems Integration Approach

The project emphasized a systems-level approach to design:

- Created a sensor fusion strategy that leveraged the strengths of multiple low-cost sensors
- Developed error compensation algorithms that enhanced accuracy beyond individual sensor capabilities
- Implemented real-time calibration techniques to maintain performance across varying conditions
- Designed modular subsystems that could be adapted to different robotic platforms

## Technologies & Methods

- LabVIEW for data acquisition and integration
- Sensor fusion algorithms
- Statistical error analysis
- Real-time system implementation
- Requirements management
- Cross-organizational collaboration
