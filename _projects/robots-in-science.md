## Project Overview

The Robots in Science project investigated the integration of robotics and computational thinking (CT) into middle school physical science instruction. This research explored how science teachers design and implement technology-integrated lessons that enhance student learning of physical science concepts while developing computational thinking practices.

Over the course of a 4-year project, we worked with 13 science and engineering teachers and over 370 students. This project examined how teachers incorporate robotics into their physical science curricula, the challenges they face, and the impact on student learning outcomes. The research provided insights into effective approaches for supporting disciplinary learning goals through technology integration.

## Research Questions

1. How can a professional development intervention support middle school science teachers in designing instructional units that incorporate robotics to enhance student CT practices and support disciplinary learning objectives?
2. What extent does teacher enactment reflect the goals and principles of the approach to integration, and what challenges do teachers face during implementation?
3. How does participation in integrated robotics lessons support student learning in the discipline?
4. What opportunities does participation in integrated robotics lessons provide for students to engage in computational thinking practices?

## Design of Teacher Professional Development

One contribution of this project was the development of a professional development model for middle school science teachers through structured workshops and coaching that included:

-   Curriculum Analysis & Integrated Unit Design: Teachers analyzed existing curriculum to identify opportunities for meaningful integration of robotics and CT that would enhance science learning goals. Through guided analysis, teachers identified specific areas where robotics could offer concrete representations of abstract science concepts in parallel with CT learning opportunities.

-   Robotics & Technology Experience: Virtual, hands-on workshops familiarized teachers with the Hummingbird educational robotics kit and Microsoft MakeCode.

-   Computational Thinking Framework: The project developed a framework to help teachers recognize and foster computational thinking practices within science contexts. This framework emphasized how CT practices like abstraction, decomposition, and algorithmic thinking could support scientific inquiry.

## Key Findings

### Teacher Development

The experiences of participating teachers underscored the importance of finding appropriate models to support student science learning. Through the professional development program:

-   Teachers developed skills and confidence to create integrated activities for their students
-   Teachers reported that designing new units was challenging but rewarding
-   Teachers at all levels of experience felt supported in their learning about robotics
-   Teachers implementing and iterating units across multiple years demonstrated changes in knowledge about technology and instructional design

### Student Learning

Robot-enhanced lessons effectively engaged students in explorations of science concepts:

-   Students showed increased interest and engagement when robotics was integrated into science lessons
-   Units covered a range of topics such as energy transfer, Newton's Laws of Motion and properties of light and sound
-   Robotics-enhanced science units supported students' development of computational thinking practices, namely pattern recognition, algorithm design, decomposition, abstraction, and data practices
-   Students (N=186) demonstrated growth in CT skills within science contexts

## Impact & Outcomes

An important goal of this project was to broaden participation in robotics and computational thinking by:

-   Lowering barriers to entry for teachers and students
-   Integrating CT and robotics activities into core content science classes

The research findings contribute to our understanding of effective models for technology integration in science education and identify areas where curriculum and instructional support could be improved. This work has implications for teacher professional development, curriculum design, and educational policy related to STEM education.
