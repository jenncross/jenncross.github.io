## Overview

As an REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) summer research assistant in Penn State's Electrical Engineering Department, I researched techniques for identifying micrometeors in radar telescope data. The project focused on analyzing signal patterns from over 10,000 meteor radar echoes to identify evidence supporting theorized micrometeor fragmentation phenomena.

## Key Contributions

-   Analyzed large-scale radar data returns from over 10,000 meteor echoes, applying skills in data processing and pattern recognition
-   Identified specific radar signal interference patterns that supported the existence of micrometeor fragmentation phenomena
-   Developed MATLAB numerical simulations of meteor fragmentation, radio science, and wave interference that supported potential sources of the observed signal interference patterns
-   Co-authored a publication in Geophysical Research Letters based on the findings
-   Presented research methodology and results to the NSF REU program and department faculty
