## Project Overview

This project is developing upper elementary school students' abilities to work with Artificial intelligence (AI) in future careers. AI will be a critical tool for influencing and increasing productivity in the future of work. As such, it is increasingly important to introduce K-12 students to basic AI knowledge and skills. Through this project, a team of robotics and education researchers at Tufts University in Massachusetts and Maryville University in St. Louis, MO will work with over 50 teachers in St. Louis County to develop a research-informed educational ecosystem bringing AI concepts to upper elementary school students.

The core innovation of this project is the development of tangible, interactive interfaces that allow young students to train machine learning models through physical demonstration rather than abstract programming. By physically manipulating robots and seeing immediate results, students develop intuitive understandings of key AI concepts like supervised learning, classification, and pattern recognition.

## Project Objectives

1. To create, test, and revise inexpensive hardware with multiple built-in AI algorithms to allow
   students to explore the learning behavior of different algorithms.
2. To create a system that is highly compatible with 5th grade classrooms. Specifically focusing
   on hardware that is safe, inexpensive, and easy for 5th graders to use and learn from and
   with.
3. To make our parts diverse and their AI algorithms flexible enough to support diversity in
   both student generated problems and solutions.
4. To design parts that can be combined to build more complex systems with engineerable
   behavior.
5. To discover through student and teacher feedback which AI algorithms are most powerful and
   which are easiest to use.

## Research Questions

1. How does the introduction of tangible artificial intelligence elements lead to changes in upper
   elementary studentsâ€™ understanding of artificial intelligence concepts and attitudes
   towards artificial intelligence?
2. How do different levels of complexity and variety of tangible artificial intelligence elements
   impact the engagement of upper elementary students and the diversity of their solutions
   and designs?
3. What are the potential benefits and challenges of introducing tangible artificial intelligence
   elements in integrated engineering and literacy activities?

## Key Innovations

### Smart Motor Platform

We developed the "Smart Motor" platform, a low-cost hardware and software toolkit that enables students to train simple machine learning models through physical demonstration. The platform includes:

-   Motion sensors that capture human demonstrations
-   Visual programming interface for algorithm selection and parameter adjustment
-   Real-time feedback mechanisms that visualize model training and prediction
-   Cross-platform compatibility with existing classroom robotics kits

### Visual Machine Learning Interface

Our visual programming environment makes machine learning concepts accessible by:

-   Representing data collection through intuitive graphical elements
-   Visualizing classification boundaries and decision-making processes
-   Providing immediate feedback during model training and testing
-   Supporting natural language explanations of AI decision-making
