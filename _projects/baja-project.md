## Overview

As Team Co-Manager and later Leadership Advisor for Olin College's Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Baja team, I managed the design and fabrication of small off-road vehicles for national competition. This project required coordinating engineering challenges with team dynamics, resource management, and stakeholder communication.

## Key Contributions

-   Led a team that grew to 30 members through strategic recruitment and effective leadership
-   Designed multimedia materials for corporate sponsorship outreach, securing funding and material support
-   Managed material and personnel resources across multiple sub-teams, developing skills in project planning and coordination
-   Served as principal interface between the team, college administration, and safety officials
-   Initiated leadership workshops for the 5-person management group, teaching essential team management skills

## Leadership Development

As the team grew, I developed a structured approach to leadership development:

-   Created mini-workshops for the management team focusing on delegation, communication, and conflict resolution
-   Implemented a system for knowledge transfer between graduating and incoming team members
-   Established documentation practices to maintain continuity across competition years
-   Developed strategies for interdisciplinary collaboration, bringing together students from mechanical, electrical, and systems engineering
